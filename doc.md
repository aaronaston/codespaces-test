# Codespaces Tests

## Per repo, per user?!

That's pretty awesome.  My current 'codespace' seems to be called 'obscure fishstick'.  These are dev containers => they have container type names :)

## Connecting to a Codespace

You can connect to the codespace from the browser or via the Github Codespaces plugin, which (in VS Code) does the 'remote' thing in the bottom left of the screen.

## Codespaces 'states'

I'm not sure what states exist for a codespace or how you're billed for them.  For 'personal' accounts you seem to have a number of minutes available per month.  If you just cut and run from a codespace, it seems to be in 'running' state.  Not sure if it shuts down ever.

## Multiple IDEs available on demand

These edits come from JupyterLab.  I'm not sure you'd do this (use multiple IDEs) in a real world scenario, but it does mean that you can have various IDEs for various projects.  For example, if this were an analytics project then perhaps JupyterLab would make more sense than VS Code.

It does raise mono-repo questions.  Suppose we have analytics 'projects'.  These are 'directories' in mono-repo land.  Would it be better to have a dedicated repo and codespace for that?  Does the repo matter?

## PWE?

You can Share|Add to Dock, but ... it doesn't seem to work.  The dock icon gets created, but it opens in a new browser window (?).

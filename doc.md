# Codespaces Tests

## Per repo, per user?!

That's pretty awesome.  My current 'codespace' seems to be called 'obscure fishstick'.  These are dev containers => they have container type names :)

## Connecting to a Codespace

You can connect to the codespace from the browser or via the Github Codespaces plugin, which (in VS Code) does the 'remote' thing in the bottom left of the screen.

## Codespaces 'states'

I'm not sure what states exist for a codespace or how you're billed for them.  For 'personal' accounts you seem to have a number of minutes available per month.  If you just cut and run from a codespace, it seems to be in 'running' state.  Not sure if it shuts down ever.
